# Task task1 - Round 2

Updated features based on brief:
Update the existing web app to add a new feature: include a button in the HTML page. When the button is pressed, it should print `ok` on the page; if not pressed, the page should render with no additional output. Ensure all changes are additive, no deletion of existing files, and there are no merge conflicts. Generate HTML, CSS, and JS as needed.
